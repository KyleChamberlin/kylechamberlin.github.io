## A tool for collaboration

I have just begun really using github for my organization at work, and because of that I am 
learning some of the features of github that I had previously ignored, or been oblivious of. 

One of the biggest parts of collaborating on github is the pull request. Everything on github
goes through pull requests. Fortunately github has provided a number of great nicities to make
it easier. Things like Issue referencing, accomplished with a simple Hashsign.
