## A tool for collaboration

I have just begun really using github for my organization at work, and because of that I am 
learning some of the features of github that I had previously ignored, or been oblivious of. 

One of the biggest parts of collaborating on github is the pull request. Everything on github
goes through pull requests. Fortunately github has provided a number of great nicities to make
it easier. I thought it might be a good idea to cover the *standard* workflow that makes github
work so well. 

# Setup

## Fork

Understanding the workflow that git expects you to use is paramount to collaborating well on code. 
So first things first, you'll need to have git installed, obviously. for the purposes of this 
we'll also need github, luckily github offers a number of tools that will help you get up and
running. [Here](http://github.com) you'll be able to sign up for an account if you don't already 
have one. The installer for the github client on Windows and OSX include git, so that is probably 
easiest way to get up and running. 

Once you are up and running with git, you need to identify the project you'd like to contribute to. 
I have taken the liberty of starting an Organization on github with a very plain repo, just a few 
ruby files. You are welcome to use that repo as a guinea pig during this process. [Link](https://github.com/LearningGitWorkflow/LearningGitWorkflow)

The first step is to fork the repo on github. *Unfortunately github doesn't yet support pull requests 
from repositories that weren't forked on github.* [Github's article on forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) 
is much better than anything I would give you, so you should read that.

## Clone

The next step is clone your fork to create a local working copy. To do this lets jump into the 
command line, :
